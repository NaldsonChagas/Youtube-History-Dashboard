# Required tests

- **New feature**: always create or update tests that cover the changed behavior. API: integration tests in `src/api/tests/`. Web: unit tests in `src/web/tests/` (api, helpers, pure logic).
- **Bug fix**: use test-first approach. First write (or adjust) the test that reproduces the bug (failing test); then implement the fix until the test passes. Applies to API and web.
- Do not consider the task complete without the corresponding tests.
